  "Solar panels, batteries, and other types of generators typically supply DC power. However, most household appliances need AC power to run.\n\nAn inverter converts DC power from your power source into useable AC power for your appliances. Many inverters also have built-in batteries for storing the converted energy.\n\nYou'll need to choose an inverter that is capable of supplying at least as much power as your peak wattage.";
